## How to Add Team Members

1) Add their image to the `images` folder
2) In the `index.html` file, search for "Add Team Member Below"
3) Copy and paste the following template to match all the others:
```html
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 sub-section person">
  <div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-12">
    <img class="img-fluid icon-img" src="images/[file name of image].jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-12 description-section">
    <h3><a href="[website of teammember]">MEMBER NAME</a></h3>
    <h4>TITLE</h4>
    <p>DESCRIPTION</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
4) Provide the file name for the image in `img src`; be sure to leave `images/` at the beginning since the image is in this directory.
5) Provide the website for the team member in `a href`. Be sure to use "http://" or "https://" at the beginning of the link.
6) After entering their name and title, make sure the description is not too long so that it is consistent with the others.
7) Save, test, commit!

## How to Add Publications

1) In the `index.html` file, search for "Add Publications Below"
2) Copy and paste the following template to match all the others:
```html
<li> Authors,
  <strong>Sirota M</strong>,
  Title, publication info,
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/********">
    **********
  </a>
</li>
```
3) Fill in everything as usual, but keep Sirota M `strong`!
4) Place the PubMed PMID where there are *********, and be sure to test the link
5) Save, test, commit!
